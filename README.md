# WoZ_WebChat
fix a issue about participant cannot hear Avatar clear.
Solution is install virtual Cables (sound input and ouput) then the sound can be transfered between two web applications (Avatar webapp to WoZ WebChat webapp).
Previously, the Avatar sound is from Avatar webapp to laptop mic to Woz WebChat leading to the avatar's sound is really low, special some participant could not hear at all.
